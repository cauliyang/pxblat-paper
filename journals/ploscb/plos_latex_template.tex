\section*{Introduction}
The rise of Python as a preferred programming language within bioinformatics is widely acknowledged as a result of its user-friendly nature, extensive libraries, and unparalleled versatility~\cite{perkel2015programming}.
A variety of libraries have been crafted to augment Python's interface, thereby amplifying the adaptability and compatibility of bioinformatics tools~\cite{putri2022analysing, cock2009biopython}.
For instance, Biopython~\cite{cock2009biopython}, a preeminent bioinformatics library, furnishes interfaces to tools like \gls{blast}~\cite{altschul1990basic} and Clustal~\cite{higgins1988clustal}.

Furthermore, the unprecedented growth in genome sequencing technologies has significantly increased the availability of genomic data, emphasizing the need for advanced tools in both research and clinical contexts.
\gls{blat}~\cite{kent2002blat}, a prominent tool in bioinformatics, is renowned for its speed in genome sequence alignments and serves as a more efficient alternative to \gls{blast}~\cite{altschul1990basic} for aligning DNA sequences with the human genome.
However, despite its popularity and effectiveness, \gls{blat}'s integration is fraught with difficulties, primarily due to its C-based implementation and reliance on \glspl{cli}, hindering seamless integration into Python projects.
Moreover, \gls{blat}'s reliance on system calls and data conversions introduces considerable overhead.
Until recently, a comprehensive solution to effectively enhance  \gls{blat}'s usability within Python frameworks was missing.

Moreover, executing extensive queries with the \gls{blat} suite often leads to inefficiencies, particularly when operations are isolated and not executed in batches.
Typically, \gls{blat}'s task allocation is sporadic, intermixed with other unrelated tasks.
Users generally face a choice: either employ standalone \gls{blat} or integrate \emph{gfServer} with \emph{gfClient}.
\gls{blat}'s standard operational model involves initiating \emph{gfServer}, conducting the sequence query through \emph{gfClient}, and subsequently terminating the server after each query.
This method becomes highly inefficient for ungrouped, numerous queries as it necessitates the repeated initialization and shutdown of \emph{gfServer}, introducing significant overhead.
This overhead is particularly evident in tasks such as indexing large references, where, for instance, indexing the human genome (hg38) alone consumes approximately five minutes.
An optimized approach would entail initiating \emph{gfServer} a single time and leveraging \emph{gfClient} to execute multiple queries.
However, the command-line-only access to \emph{gfServer} and \emph{gfClient} complicates this process.
This limitation necessitates the management of system calls (like \emph{subprocess} or \emph{os.system}), the handling of intermediate temporary files, and dealing with format conversion, all of which cumulatively degrade performance.

\gls{pxblat} is proposed as a solution that allows for the programmatic use of \gls{blat}, ensuring its smooth integration into new algorithms or analytical pipelines within the Python ecosystem.
It acts as a conduit, merging the high-performance capabilities of \gls{blat} with Python's versatility while ensuring data reproducibility.
The primary goal of \gls{pxblat} is to bridge the gap in the current landscape by providing a Python binding library tailored specifically for \gls{blat}, addressing both the efficiency bottlenecks and the ergonomic challenges of its integration.

%\end{figure}

The design of \gls{pxblat} is anchored in the principles of readability and simplicity, fostering an intuitive user interface that minimizes the learning curve for users.
In our quest to streamline complexity and amplify both usability and performance, we meticulously extracted the core implementation of \gls{blat} from the broader \gls{ucsc} codebase, significantly reducing dependency overhead.

We preserved the integrity of the original C codebase while reimplementing key \gls{blat} \(\left(\mathtt{V}37.1\right)\) utilities such as \emph{faTwoBit}, \emph{gfServer}, and \emph{gfClient} in C\texttt{++}.
This strategic choice not only modernizes the code but also enhances maintainability and scalability.
The integration of the revamped C\texttt{++} code with \gls{pxblat} was achieved using Pybind11~\cite{pybind11}, a lightweight, seamless method for interfacing C\texttt{++} and Python.

This approach ensures a direct and efficient interaction with \gls{blat}'s functions, upholding the original performance benchmarks and reliability of \gls{blat}.
Simultaneously, it extends the framework's functionality, aligning it with modern computational standards and making it a robust tool in the bioinformatics toolkit (Table~\ref{tab:apicmp}).

\begin{table}[!ht]
	\centering
	\caption{{\bf Overview of features of \gls{pxblat} compared with \gls{blat}.}}\label{tab:apicmp}
	\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}

        This table presents a comprehensive comparison between the features offered by \gls{pxblat} and \gls{blat}.
        Features are denoted with a \cmark{} to signify availability and an \xmark{} to indicate absence.
        Notably, \gls{pxblat} showcases significant enhancements, particularly in server management (e.g., wait server), data conversion (e.g., fasta to bit, bit to fasta), and enriched user interaction (e.g., shell completion).
        These advancements firmly establish \gls{pxblat} as a superior and more versatile alternative to the conventional \gls{blat} tool.
	\end{flushleft}
\end{table}

\gls{pxblat} delivers its query results in alignment with the \emph{QueryResult} class of Biopython~\cite{cock2009biopython}, enabling seamless manipulation of query outputs using Biopython's comprehensive suite of features (Listing~\ref{listing:example}).
This integration effectively streamlines the post-query workflow, allowing users to leverage the full potential of Biopython in their sequence alignment tasks.
Significantly, \gls{pxblat} negates the necessity for intermediate files by conducting all operations in memory.
This advancement eliminates the often cumbersome and time-consuming step of data format conversion, enabling users to concentrate on the core aspects of sequence alignment.
To enhance user flexibility, the necessity for input and output files has been made optional, aligning with diverse user preferences and workflows.

\begin{listing}
	\inputminted[breaklines]{python}{code/example1.py}
	\caption{{\bf \gls{api} Example.} The code snippet shows how to use the \gls{api} of \gls{pxblat},
		and the query result can be iterated. More code examples can be found at \url{https://pxblat.readthedocs.io/en}}
	\label{listing:example}
\end{listing}

Recognizing the latency and potential performance bottlenecks induced by system calls, \gls{pxblat} minimizes their usage, thereby streamlining operations and enhancing overall efficiency, as depicted in Fig~\ref{fig:performance}.
Additionally, \gls{pxblat} simplifies server status retrieval, circumventing the complexities and potential pitfalls of log file manipulation, particularly in concurrent usage scenarios.
To further elevate the user experience and operational efficiency, \gls{pxblat} integrates several ergonomic features.
These include real-time server readiness checks for alignments, automatic port retries when the default is in use, and the capability to latch onto an already running server if available.
These features collectively ensure a smoother, more efficient alignment process, reducing downtime and maximizing productivity.

To facilitate a smooth user onboarding experience, we offer an extensive range of examples and comprehensive documentation (Listing~\ref{listing:example}).
\gls{pxblat} introduces a robust set of \glspl{api}, including the classes \emph{Server} and \emph{Client}, along with a suite of functions designed to replicate the capabilities of the \gls{blat} suite.
These classes mirror the utilities of the \gls{cli} tools \emph{gfServer} and \emph{gfClient}, respectively, but with added flexibility to accommodate a wider range of user requirements.
Key functions such as \emph{start\_server}, \emph{query\_server}, \emph{status\_server}, \emph{fa2twobit}, and \emph{twobit2fa} are provided to cater to diverse usage scenarios.
Rigorous testing and development protocols, incorporating \gls{ci} and \gls{cd}, have been employed to ensure high code quality and reliability.

Moreover, \gls{pxblat} utilizes type annotations in its public classes and functions.
This not only reinforces code quality and correctness through type checking and static analysis but also enhances the development experience.
The annotated types facilitate automatic suggestion and correction of function signatures in development environments, streamlining the coding process.

In addition to the \glspl{api}, \gls{pxblat} features \gls{cli} utilities crafted through its \glspl{api}, boasting shell completion for various systems to augment its versatility (Table~\ref{tab:apicmp}).
Recognizing the diverse technological landscape, we provide the library in wheel format compatible with multiple platforms, including Linux x86-64, macOS x86-64, and macOS arm64.
This ensures a seamless installation process, free from the complexities of C library dependencies, making it straightforward and user-friendly.

\subsection*{Performance on real datasets}

The efficacy and performance of \gls{pxblat} were rigorously benchmarked against \gls{blat} \(\left(\mathtt{V}37.1\right)\) utilizing eight distinct sample sets of FASTA files.
Each set comprised a group of samples, ranging from 50 to 600 samples per set.
The datasets are meticulously sampled from chromosome 20 of the Human Genome (hg38), with each dataset containing a single sequence.
These sequences varied in length from \num{1000} bp to \num{3000} bp, encompassing a spectrum of typical use-case scenarios (Fig~\ref{fig:fas_len}).

\end{figure}

To ascertain the accuracy and reliability of \gls{pxblat}, we conducted a comparative analysis of the \glspl{hsp} generated by both \gls{blat} and \gls{pxblat} for each sample.
This comparison revealed a high degree of concordance between the \glspl{hsp} produced by \gls{pxblat} and those generated by \gls{blat}, affirming the fidelity of \gls{pxblat}'s output (\nameref{S2_Table}).

The benchmarking process was carried out on an Apple M1 Pro running macOS 13.4.1 (arm64).
For launching \gls{blat}, system calls were utilized, and the execution time was meticulously measured using the time library.
Each group of FASTA files underwent three experimental runs, facilitating a comprehensive assessment of performance.
The results highlighted the efficiency of \gls{pxblat}, with observed speedups ranging from 1.00 to 1.77 times compared to the \gls{blat} execution (Fig~\ref{fig:performance}).

\begin{figure}[!h]
